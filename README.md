👋 Hi, my name is Renato Montufar, I'm a mobile app developer. I have just over nine years of experience developing applications with Java/Kotlin and Swift. I met flutter in 2019 and since then I have decided to polish my skills with this framework. I like to make open source code to help others and also to make my work known. I really like the UI/UX. I live in Guatemala 🇬🇹 😀
